## Quotes.py
Python script to get one quote a day. Uses api calls to QuotesOnDesign and TheySaidSo.

To run type __python quotes.py [category_name]__ on linux command line.

You can add the above line to your .bashrc, this will present you with a quote each time you start your terminal (and since the api call will be made only once during the whole day, no worries about slowing down).
