## Quotes.py
Python script to get one quote a day. Uses api calls to QuotesOnDesign and TheySaidSo.

To run type __python quotes.py [category_name]__ on linux command line.

You can add the above line to your .bashrc, this will present you with a quote each time you start your terminal (and since the api call will be made only once during the whole day, no worries about slowing down).

## Walmart Price Alert
A django app made for an internal walmart hackathon. The app is basically a user driven discount-model ecommerce store. You like a product, you 'request' a discount on it. Others who also want a discount do the same. Eventually, the number of people requesting the discount reach a certain mass that the manufacturer/vendor can give a discount.
Note: the app is in no way production ready and it comes with no warranty.
